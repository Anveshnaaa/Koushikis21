            <h1>21 Times I Think Long Distance Sucks and I Want You Next to Me</h1>
            <p>All those moments when I just wish you were here... 💔</p>
            
            <ol class="butterflies-list">
                <li>When I see any random couple holding hands.</li>
                <li>When I wear something or do something you once complimented.</li>
                <li>When I see anything even a little cool I wanna show it to you, like even a pretty sunset I feel like I wanna see it with you.</li>
                <li>When you sound sad and I feel like if I was physically there I could have helped.</li>
                <li>When you act so dumb and stupid and I feel like breaking your stupid face ki itna dumb cheez bol kaise sakta hai.</li>
                <li>When I see coconut water.</li>
                <li>I see any guy even give compliment to their gf.</li>
                <li>Every public event you can bring a +1.</li>
                <li>When I have good/bad news and my first instinct is to call you but stupid time zone.</li>
                <li>When I am waiting for a reply, and I keep looking at my phone... I wanna just bash your head that wtf are you so busy with. IRL this wasn't required.</li>
                <li>When I feel so far away that it scares me — like I'm missing out on being your everyday person.</li>
                <li>I want someone to back me up in front of people.</li>
                <li>When you feel low and I just say stupid things that cannot fix it and you just give up on me and leave the call.</li>
                <li>When I feel like I am so far that I can never be fun or something you look forward to.</li>
                <li>If I enjoy with people I feel like how do I recreate this experience with you.</li>
                <li>When you look cute over the video call omggg aww.</li>
                <li>When you give other people more of your time, and I have that tiny "if I were there, I'd keep you glued to me" jealousy moment.</li>
                <li>When I stay up late, or wake up really early it's all silent and you're the only thought.</li>
                <li>When someone is mean to me I feel like I wanna get back to you and rant about it, call doesn't give that vibe, IRL you would make me sit on your lap, listen to me cry, joke about it and just uplift my mood.</li>
                <li>When you give everyone else more time than me, I feel like abhi if I were there kahi jaane hi nahi deti, I would keep you glued.</li>
                <li>When you have a breakdown and I know physical comfort from me could fix it, but calls just ruin it for both of us, I feel useless you feel you have nobody that understands.</li>

            <h1>21 Times You Gave Me Butterflies</h1>
            <p>Some of these I’ve said a hundred times, some once or twice, and some I’ve never said before.</p>
            <ol class="butterflies-list">
                <li>Unimall Incident: Something cutesyyy had happened between us the previous evening, and the next day you met me so and cold, distant. I was lowkey terrified you were going to say it was all a mistake. We werent even a thing then then I was sad because I’d had kinda been secretly looking forward to it becoming something.</li>
                <li>The Bus Ride to Jalandhar: We were just friends then, going to get my iPad fixed or something, I don’t even fully remember why. We sat on the bus and there was so much space —but you still kind of pushed into me, sat close. I acted normal, but inside I was gone. Maybe its in my head but lowkey thats what i thought.</li>
                <li><strong>The Dance Something Days:</strong> We weren’t really a thing, but everyone kind of thought we were and i guess i loved that. We never said “I like you,” but there were all those small, not-so-friendly touches and glances kinda stuff was happening and that wasnt how we both were before. It wasn’t over the top, just soft hints everytime did give me butterflies for sure.</li>
                <li><strong>Outside the Hostel:</strong> We were just sitting there, talking, and then you touched me. It wasn’t anything dramatic, but I genuienly felt something shift inside me. I remember thinking, “Okay, I don’t feel that when anyone else touches me. He has something or maybe I have something for him. Dude i have said it 100 times but this was my max butterflies ever.</li>
                <li><strong>That Night We Got Back Late:</strong> The guards were around but not paying attention. I kissed you anyway. And you just sat down on the floor in that confident, SRK-like way — my full-on Bollywood moment.</li>
                <li><strong>The Star Nights:</strong> We used to just sit and stare at that one stupid star, pretending it was something substantial but we were just killing time. Some close moments during that were very cutesy and yeah cute.</li>
                <li>That Winter Break: We weren’t officially serious then. I kept picking fights, we both were back home maybe I was scared or confused about what I wanted out of this relationship. But when I came back to college and saw you, you gave me a forehead kiss and just walked along and something just clicked. I knew then that I definitely want this.</li>
                <li>The Temple Climb — That climb to the temple — I was out of breath every two minutes, but when we finally reached, I don’t know, I’ve never felt anything that strong. It felt like God was genuinely listening to me. And it gave me butterflies — standing there with you, feeling that this is someone I want beside me every time I come here. I wanted God to hear me that day, to know that I want to keep coming back here again and again, with you. That moment made me feel closer to God — and somehow, even closer to the fact that I want to be with you, no matter what.</li>
                <li>When I Was Sick: We were living as Namratha Suket ka neighbours and one day I was sick, and I don’t know if you were trying to impress me or if it was out of concern — but let me just believe it was the second one. You got haldi milk did all that taking care shenanigans, and it sounds so small, but it wasn’t. It was you taking care of me in the simplest, sweetest way made me feel good.</li>
                <li>The Note You Wrote: You wrote a note for me before i was going to US the one you locked with a password and everything. I still go back to it sometimes. You never write, you’re honestly so lazy with that stuff, but you took the time to do it for me. Every time I read it, it makes me feel important. Whenever I feel low, I open it again, and it just makes everything a little lighter.</li>
                <li>When I Took That Flight: That fight from US to india, I’d missed flights, been a mess, and still, when I landed, I was only thinking..when is he gonna come? Do I look good? Will he like me? Will it feel the same? Those 30 minutes waiting at the delhi airport for you were crazy. You know what i love delhi airport now..coz i remember how happy i was to see you, and how happy i will be whenever i come to see you next.</li>
                <li>The Bus Ride Back from Delhi: Delhi airport to ur home for like a month. That whole ride was just unreal. I kept thinking, am I really here? I’d spent so long in the U.S. still doubting if we’d ever actually meet again, and suddenly there you were..right beside me. The entire time I couldn’t stop feeling like it was all a dream. But then I’d look at you, hug you, and realize no, this is real. You’re real. And that realization gave me the craziest butterflies.</li>
                <li>The Ring Thing: You kept getting CaratLane notifications every day, and for four whole days I was like omg i hope he isnt thinking of something crazyyyy. U went out to get some delivery and then you were you’d just gonnakeep it away in ur cupboard but looked at me and suddenly you went, “fuck it,” and gave it to me to open. The way you said that, the look on your face i have never heard i cooler “fuck-it” most effortless moment ever. I still replay it in my head sometimes.</li>
                <li>The Restaurant Speech: When we went to that restaurant after getting the ring and finally had a little personal space, you gave that whole speech. I don’t think I’ve ever gotten that much limelight or importance fI can’t even explain how I felt like it wasn’t about the ring ik its just a promisering. But it was serious enough to make me think, maybe someday, it actually could be. Butterflies indeed.</li>
                <li>The Accident: You gave me butterflies even in something as terrifying as that. We both fell off, there was a crowd there was a whole ass truck I still can’t believe that all you could think of was, “Is Anveshna fine?” Nothing else. It was such a selfless moment, because honestly, I would’ve thought of a thousand other things first. But you didn’t. You just cared.</li>
                <li>Home Dinner Date — We had that home dinner date, and I remember getting ready, walking out of the bathroom, and then you played Ed Sheeran. You were standing there in that black shirt, dancing, the romantic music. I just stood there thinking, oh my god, this is what princess treatment actually feels like.</li>
                <li>The Cab to Delhi: We were both half-asleep, and suddenly the driver hit the brakes hard. It was a proper jump scare, but before even looking around, you just turned to me to check if I was fine ki Anveshna. It was the smallest thing, but it said everything.</li>
                <li>Before the Surprise Trip: Then once i was home and time of going back to US was getting closer i was trying to convince my mom to let me go for just a few days, and she kept saying no. I kept thinking maybe I’ll only get to see you at the airport for an hour or two — but somehow, after all the convincing and idhar-udhar, I knew I was actually going to be able to surprise you. For the night before the surprise I couldn’t sleep. My mind just kept looping the same thought I’m going to see Koushik again. And that feeling alone was just omggg awwww.</li>
                <li>When I Came to Surprise You: When I came to surprise you like the last time abhi in August and Aadarsh wouldnt leave the room I kept thinking, when do I get to hug him? Finally, I gave up. Once he left, I just crashed on the bed, exhausted ki mehhh dont care about hugs.. And then you came, you lay over me. I don’t know if you remember it the way I do, but those few minutes, idk the warmth ur presence it was something else. Not even about the kissing and stuff after, just the feeling of finally having you there again after so long.</li>
                <li>When You Don’t Give Up: Every time I fight and say I want it over. I want to hear you say, “no, I don’t want this to be over. Let’s fix it”. Every time you don’t give up, it gives me butterfles maybe not the pretty kind, but the real, kind. The truth is, sometimes I say I want to give up just to see if you would. I know it doesn’t make sense, and you probably think I’m the worst when I do it, but it’s just because in those moments, I feel unimportant. Saying I want it to end is my stupid way of asking if I still matter and every time you say I do, it reminds me I’m not ready to lose this.</li>
                <li>When I Fight With You: I know the number of times I fight with you probably makes it look like I want this to end, but most of the time it’s never that. There are only two reasons I ever get that way. One, it’s pure frustration of not being together. And two, it’s because I’m so serious about us that whenever something feels off, I panic. I start thinking that the future I’ve imagined for us might get ruined. I know it’s wrong, I know I overreact, but it only comes from wanting this so badly. I don’t ever want you to do something that gives me a reason to think we don’t have a future, because I genuinely want one with you. My fights might not show it, but every one of them comes from a place of wanting to protect what we have.</li>
